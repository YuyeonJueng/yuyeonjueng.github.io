title: "If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy And I can take you for a ride I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm Where the music don't stop for life Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes Shining just the way I like If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company You met me at the perfect time"
